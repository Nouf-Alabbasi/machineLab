## goal: 
build machanism that would be part of clock

## idea
I was really inspired by [Ross McSweeney kinetic sculpture](https://parametrichouse.com/kinetic-wave-sculpture/) and all the movment that it had even though it was built from wood. I also find water and underwater creatures to be mesmerising. 
For this project I think I might create a story that takes place under water. a temporary idea is to tell the story of a shirmp who lives under water.


## mechanics and rough draft
I think it might be intresting to the geneva stop mechanism to control the background
